# Train Schedule Database

I created a Firebase backed train schedule application
Used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.
Used Firebase to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js, which will parse, validate, and display dates and times in JS, to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.
